# violence-detection-using-LRCN
Violence detection model is just another model which can detect violence in videos using an open dataset present on kaggle of 2000 videos.The unique feature is the combination of convolutional layers (Conv2D) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. So it is based on LRCN model
